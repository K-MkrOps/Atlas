# Installation

Getting up and running requires just a few steps, but this can be tricky, 
depending on your platform and current environment. Please follow the directions 
for your environment.

## Pre-Install Checklist

* [ ] Clone the repository
* [ ] Install Node.js v16 or later
* [ ] Install Python >=3.6 + [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), C++, and
  other build tools. See the [Mediasoup install instructions](https://mediasoup.org/documentation/v3/mediasoup/installation/)
  for full details.
* [ ] Install Docker (optional but highly recommended)
* [ ] (Optional) If you're NOT using docker, install MariaDB and Redis.

You should now be ready to follow the [Quick Start](#quick-start) instructions.

### Clone the repository

A lot has changed during development, and our monorepo has gotten quite large.
To avoid cloning the entire thing, use this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/AtlasFoundation/Atlas --depth 1
```

### Ensure you are on Node 16 or above
You **must** have Node 16 or above installed.

A version manager can be helpful for this:
 - NodeJS only: [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
 - Polyglot: [ASDF](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf)

Before running the engine, please check `node --version`
If you are using a node version below 16, please update or nothing will work. 
You will know you are having issues if you try to install at root and are 
getting dependency errors.

### Docker is your friend

You don't need to use [Docker]((https://docs.docker.com/)), but it will make 
your life much easier.
If you don't wish to use Docker, you will need to setup mariadb and redis on 
your machine. You can find credentials in `atlas/scripts/docker-compose.yml`

## Quick Start

If you are lucky, this will just work. However, you may encounter some
issues. Make sure you are running Node 16, and check your dependencies.

```
cd path/to/atlas
npm install
npm run dev-docker
npm run dev-reinit
npm run dev
```

### Setup Elastic Search & Grafana

Elastic Search and Grafana will be automatically launched with `npm run dev`.

Elasticsearch & Grafana will be running on localhost port 9200 & 5601 respectively.

This will automatically set up and run Redis/MariaDB docker
containers, and client/server/game-server instances.

In a browser, navigate to https://127.0.0.1:3000/location/default

The database seeding process creates a test empty location called 'test'.
It can be navigated to by going to 'https://127.0.0.1:3000/location/default'

As of this writing, the cert provided in the atlas package for local use is
not adequately signed. Browsers will throw up warnings about going to insecure
pages. You should be able to tell the browser to ignore it, usually by clicking
on some sort of 'advanced options' button or link and then something along the
lines of 'go there anyway'.

Chrome sometimes does not show a clickable option on the warning. If so, just
type ```badidea``` or ```thisisunsafe``` when on that page. You don't enter
that into the address bar or into a text box, Chrome is just passively listening
for those commands.

### Admin System and User Setup
You can administrate many features from the admin panel at https://localhost:3000/admin

How to make a user an admin:

Create a user at `https://localhost:3000/`

To locate your User ID:
In Chrome Dev Tools console, write `copy(userId)`. This will copy your User ID
(As shown in attached screenshot). Paste it in and run the following command in
a 'nix shell (e.g. Bash, ZSH):

`npm run make-user-admin -- --id={COPIED_USER_ID}`

Example:
`npm run make-user-admin -- --id=c06b0210-453e-11ec-afc3-c57a57eeb1ac`

2. TODO: Improve with email/phone ID support

Alternate Method:
1. Look up in User table and change userRole to 'admin'
2. Dev DB credentials can be found here: packages/ops/docker-compose-local.yml#L42
3. Suggested: beekeeperstudio.io

Test user Admin privileges by going to `/admin`
